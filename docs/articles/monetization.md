Zuplo enables you to monetize your APIs. It provides a powerful set of defaults,
while maintaining a flexible implementation to suit your needs. It enables you
to create plans with different limits and features for your API.

A pricing page is created with your
[Zuplo Developer Portal](/docs/articles/developer-portal.md). Customers can see
and sign up to the plans you've configured for your API.

You can also access API analytics to understand how your customers are using
your API.

## About This Guide

At the end of this guide, you will have a fully monetized API with Zuplo. The
API will have multiple plans with different limits.

The guide is divided into the following sections:

- [Step 1 - Setup Developer Portal Monetization](/docs/articles/monetization-dev-portal-setup.md)
- [Step 2 - Connect Stripe Webhook](/docs/articles/monetization-webhook-setup.md)
- [Step 3 - Monetization Policy](/docs/articles/monetization-policy-setup.md)

## Payments

Zuplo uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) as the billing and payments processor.
You will need to create a Stripe account to use Zuplo's monetization features.
