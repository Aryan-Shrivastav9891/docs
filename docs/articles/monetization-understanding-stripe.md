title: Step 1 - Stripe + Zuplo
---

To accept payments from your customers, Zuplo uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com)
as the billing and payments processor. You will need to create a Stripe account
to use Zuplo's monetization features.

With Stripe, you can easily define your pricing plans, create payment checkouts
and manage your customers' subscriptions. Zuplo will handle the API access
control based on the customer's subscription in Stripe.

In Zuplo, the different API plans are called _**Plans**_. In Stripe, the pricing
plans are called _**Products**_. Each API plan in Zuplo is connected to a
product in Stripe as follows:

In the next section, we will walk you through the process of setting up your
Stripe account and integrating it with your Zuplo project.
