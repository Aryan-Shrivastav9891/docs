title: Step 2 - Create your Stripe Product
---

To create a product in Stripe, you will need to have a Stripe account. If you
don't have one, you can create one at [Stripe's website](https://stripe.com).

Once you have your Stripe account, start by creating the "Basic" product.

1. Open the **Product Catalog** in the Stripe Dashboard (if you can't find, you
   can use the search bar at the top of the page).
2. Click on the **Add product** button.
3. Fill in the product details as in the image below:

4. Click on the **Add product** button.
5. Repeat the process to create the "Pro" product with the details:
   - **Name**: Pro
   - **Description**: Pro plan for the API
   - **Pricing model**: Recurring
   - **Billing frequency**: Monthly
   - **Price**: $50 USD

Next, we will create a simple API with Zuplo to monetize it.
