Planning to build a new public customer or partner API but not sure where to start your research?

On June 9, 2022 we were joined by Utsav Shah of fast growing startup Vanta (and host of the [Software at Scale](https://www.softwareatscale.dev/) podcast). Utsav shared the recent customer API he built, why Kanye West is behind his extensive rate limiting policies, and his process of onboarding users to a new API.
